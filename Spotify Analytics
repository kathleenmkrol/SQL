# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );


#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#First, I determined how many songs per artist were in the dataset. 

-- How many songs does each artist have in this dataset? List highest to lowest.

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc;

#Then, I explored the average danceability per artist, ordered from highest to lowest to see which artists have highest (and lowest) danceability ratings on average.
-- List average danceability per artist, from highest to lowest.

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) desc;

#I was curious if danceability was associated with tempo, so I listed the top artists by average tempo. Then I explored other variables that I thought might be associated with danceability.
-- Are the top three artists for danceability the same as the top artists for tempo? (top 3 are J Balvin, Los Legesndarios, and Riton)

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability), AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(tempo) desc;


--View averages of several variables per artist to see what those with high popularity rankings have in common.

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(song_key), AVG(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(tempo) desc;

--Note Olivia Rodrigo is within the top 5 most popular artists on this list, and is also within the top 5 for danceability and energy.

#Last, out of curiosity, I listed the artists who created the top 5 longest songs.
--What artist(s) released the 5 longest songs?

SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 5;
